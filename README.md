I think i should update to you although I cannot finish all today. 

please see the picture in the repo to see my progress.

i have no knowledge in front-end before, but this assignment reminds me of the android mobile app course where we need to design the views. I think the components here play the smae role as fragment (in android development), but I have trouble to stuff things in the container. (the styled-components library cannot be imported)

Another difficulty I was confronted today is to wrap the height (to make the things inside fully fill the container vertically).
